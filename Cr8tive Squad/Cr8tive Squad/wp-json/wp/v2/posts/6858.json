Stressing the importance of digital media marketing is past the point of redundant. The largest online platforms \u2013 Google and Facebook \u2013 have made their interfaces so simple and user-friendly that even the unsaviest of business owners can set up and manage search engine and social media campaigns. Despite this ease, many of these already time-deprived business owners find that they simply do not have the extra hours to self-manage an active digital marketing campaign. Even less are in a position to afford a dedicated employee to figure it all out.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of this sudden virtual demand over the past decade, digital marketing agencies have emerged everywhere. From small rural communities to bustling metropolitan cities, single-person start-ups to traditional media providers, have all recognized the need to become digital tech mediators between brands and consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to Google and Facebook\u2019s easy-to-use systems, online review management, email marketing, and programmatic targeting platforms offer highly tailored solutions to promote brand awareness and encourage consumer engagement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0-Select a few relevant keywords<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0-Identify your ideal target audience<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0\u00a0-Go<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201c<em>[these] tactical solutions\u2026were part of a bigger pitch that these agencies could help drive supposed digital transformation<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/marketing\/digital-agencies-struggle-new-market-reality\/\">Shareen Pathak, Digiday<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Digital strategies and tactics are driven by data. Consumers\u2019 online habits, purchasing tendencies, social media engagement, not to mention the vast range of consumer subsets, are all utilized to deliver hyper-specific brand messages. These data-driven strategies can then be measured and compiled into campaign analytic reports, which quantify a campaign in action. Analytics showcase the in-depth, granular metrics of a campaign\u2013 engagement, demographics, etc \u2013 and become a powerful and effective tool in measuring success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Reporting can aid your optimization efforts but doesn\u2019t bring a direct ROI for you or the company.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/online-metrics.com\/analytics-ninja\/\">Paul Koks, Online Metrics<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Yet as exciting and appealing as campaign metrics are, the reality of analytical data is not as impressive.

Not at the end of the month.

Every business, every product, every audience is unique. And that uniqueness is subject to change \u2014 day-by-day, hour-by-hour.<\/p>\n<p>Marketing consultants actively monitor and tweak campaigns based on brand, promotion, and audience uniqueness. Not only to ensure that every penny of a marketing budget is translating into views and clicks, but ultimately that those views and clicks are further converting into bottom-line revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Avelyn Ng with Marketing-Interactive\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketing-interactive.com\/how-marketers-are-showing-their-spend-is-leading-to-sales-conversions\/\">further illustrates the importance of looking beyond marketing<\/a>, cautioning that \u201cmarketers must move away from numbers of views and measures of engagement\u201d and instead \u201cleverage advanced econometric and analytics tools to map\u2026variables such as revenue growth, profit increase and brand love.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the end, what matters most to brands and businesses is increasing sales. Watching social media audiences grow and seeing how many clicks a programmatic ad campaign performed are no doubt exciting. But, marketing consultants analyze the bigger picture in order to help their clients achieve bottom-line success.<\/p>\n<p>Building Brands Marketing &amp; Consulting is a full service marketing consulting firm and advertising agency located in Victoria, TX serving businesses from Victoria to Katy, and the entire Gulf Coast region in between.
