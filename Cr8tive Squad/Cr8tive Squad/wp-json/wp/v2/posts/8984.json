By having data from research, you can always identify digital gaps in the market to stay ahead of the competitive curve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of <b><i>Cash Tacos<\/i><\/b>, we found that most future competitors didn&#8217;t provide a proper use of <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/h1-tag\/#:~:text=The%20H1%20tag%20is%20an,like%20H2%2C%20H3%2C%20etc.\">H Tags<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/community\/q\/topic\/63749\/is-title-tag-length-actually-important\">Title Tags were too long<\/a> and that pages didn\u2019t have enough text to support the webpage\u2019s intent.

Understanding data points such as these (and this can be just the tip of the iceberg) helps emphasize the value that competitor research has in today&#8217;s digital landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><i>In the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.loom.com\/\"><i>Loom Video<\/i><\/a><i> that you\u2019ll see below, we will examine key competitors of <\/i><b><i>Cash Tacos<\/i><\/b><i> in the Katy area.

The SEO structure and information available do not follow any sort of website \u201cguideline\u201d set by Google, etc. This tells us that with proper keyword research applied to our new website\u2019s content, plus experienced SEO tactics implemented, <b><i>Cash Tacos<\/i><\/b> isn\u2019t going to have a tough time organically ranking once launching based on research that\u2019s been conducted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><i>ABOVE IMAGE &#8211; Side Note: During our discovery, we even noticed on this page one ranking website that information wasn\u2019t appropriately filled in (from template that was used).

This frequency strikes a balance between action and observation. Not over-monitoring your competition allows you to dedicate more resources to executing your own strategy. However, checking in at least quarterly or annually ensures you aren&#8217;t blindsided by any significant strategic shifts or new entries in your market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if <b><i>Cash Tacos<\/i><\/b> reviewed their main competitor and discovered that they\u2019re planning to introduce a vegetarian menu by Fall of 2029, this information could be considered helpful. By knowing this, <b><i>Cash Tacos<\/i><\/b> could plan their 2030 product innovations, consider vegetarian options if they see their competition become successful with it or even double down on meat-based options to create themselves a marketplace niche. Asking these questions, and finding the answers along the way, when diving into competitor research can help ensure a business doesn\u2019t get left behind when planning to establish themselves digitally in a new market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><br>But how do you always know what questions to ask?<\/b><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we\u2019ve compiled a list of <i>10 Questions to Ask Before Diving into Competitor Research<\/i> to help you get this process started!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>10 Questions to Ask Before Diving into Competitor Research<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What type of content resonates with their customers?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Who makes up their target customer base?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do they have active customer engagement?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is their website user-friendly?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do their products closely mimic yours?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What platforms do they use for engagement?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is their website&#8217;s loading speed?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do their products have unique selling points (USPs) that overshadow yours?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which websites link back to your competitor&#8217;s but not yours?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What keywords do they use in their product descriptions?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with the information throughout this blog, and questions to ask in your competitor research, you can identify competitive edge, improvement areas, and how to<i> leverage your data<\/i>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Concluding Thoughts<\/b><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The value of competitor research cannot be overstated.
