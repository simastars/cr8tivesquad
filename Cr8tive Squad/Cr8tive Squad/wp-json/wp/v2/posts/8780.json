A company increases its brand equity by having consistent characteristics that its audience or consumers enjoy. Also, the brand voice is something that the consumer can easily relate to. Here are some common forms of brand personalities that the brand usually uses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elegance, pricy, prestige &#8211; relate to the sophistication<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carefree and youthful &#8211; relate to the excitement<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Athletic, outdoorsy, rough traits &#8211; relate to a rugged personality<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kind, thoughtful, innocent, and trustworthiness &#8211; relate to sincerity<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful, leadership,\u00a0\u00a0influential &#8211;\u00a0\u00a0signifies competence<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status, exclusivity, and allure &#8211; relate to desirability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 500;\">The Importance of Brand Personality<\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in this world where every industry is filled with brands that want to clamber over each other to look authentic to their audiences. Therefore, building an attractive and easily distinguishable brand personality is important to stay in business in the competitive world. People also reach out to a reliable\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.finnpartners.com\/\">PR agency<\/a>\u00a0to ensure they have professionals to take care of their marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a brand with unique and specific character traits will help you make it more human. Customers will feel concerned by its values and behaviours. They will feel that they are building a relationship with an individual that builds an attachment to the brand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-established brand voice helps to develop a brand\u2019s equity and distinguish an organization or business from its competition while cultivating or maintaining an edge in the industry.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 500;\">How to Develop a Brand Voice or Brand Personality?<\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Determine Your Mission and Basic Principles<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concentrating on your customers is crucial, but how can you engage them if you don\u2019t understand what your company stands for? Values have significance because they influence who we are. The same is the case for your company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outlining your key values should be your first step. What matters most to your company? Once you have them down on paper, you should include them in your mission statement. The goal of your company and how you plan to serve your clients are stated in your mission statement. And your mission statement will act as the foundation of your brand\u2019s voice or personality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any honest brand is committed to providing its consumers with reliable and best products. They produce their formulae, held to a high standard of openness and safety. You can use a mission statement as a roadmap to steer your business decisions in the direction of your brand personality.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wondering how should a mission statement be written? It doesn\u2019t matter how long or short your mission statement is\u2014the goal is to express your company\u2019s core values and beliefs. Your mission statement must contain the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the business offers<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who are you selling to<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are the specific values behind your business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Research Your Competition<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to stand out from your competitors, so you need to understand what companies stand opposite you. If every company in your industry follows the same brand voice, you might need to take another path to allow your audiences to observe you among the competitors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0So, learn more about your competitors to make an informed decision. Here are a few things that you need to look for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check the reviews and comments online to understand what people like about your competitors<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What other companies are doing on their social media pages and websites<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use modern tools to extract information about your competitors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Define Your Target Audience<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your target audience is the people your business represents and wants to interact with and engage with, and you need to consider them to create the brand personality. Of course, a luxury watch brand will have a different personality than the men\u2019s supporting gear business. When you know your audience, you can shape your brand to attract them easily.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the few questions you need to ask yourself to build a brand personality after knowing your audience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is my audience dive by logic or emotions?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does my target audience care about?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does my audience care more about quality, affordability, or luxury?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does my audience dislike or like?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Put Brand Personality Traits on Paper<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you effectively follow the steps mentioned above, it\u2019s time to write down personality traits. Write down an adjective representing your brand and choose 3 to 4 traits from your list. Once you know your specific traits, you can understand where your business fits best- is your brand rugged, sophisticated, or sincere?<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: inherit;\">Stay Consistent<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you build your brand personality, there is one thing that you should never forget: stay consistent. This means whatever brand voice you choose, you should stick to it. If not, your brand will not have a distinct voice, and you will not be able to connect with the audience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, staying consistent means, you also need to choose the same colour palette, font, and imagery across the brand. Consistency will allow you to develop recognition of your business, which is more important for startups and small businesses. But you may need to tweak the brand voice if you believe something is not working.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 500;\">Bottom Line<\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell, brand personality is important to attract customers and stand out in the market. Whether you have a small business or a bigger corporation, you need to develop a brand personality to build a strong foundation in the market and expand your business in the future. So, start building a brand personality with the help of mentioned steps in the article.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need help, hire PR agency experts who can opt for the right traits for your company. Work with professionals who can make this process seamless for you and give you the results you are looking for.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Brand Personality?
