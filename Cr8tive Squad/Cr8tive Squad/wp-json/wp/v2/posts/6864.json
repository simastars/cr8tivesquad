And Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have become an integral part of any successful modern-day approach. While many traditional methods still work, they make up a smaller and smaller part of a successful marketing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking full advantage of what the newest technologies have to offer, businesses are able to streamline their marketing efforts and improve their company&#8217;s bottom line. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the role of AI and ML in digital marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid Search Advertising<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you set the budget for <a href=\"http:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/search-engine-marketing\/\">paid search ads<\/a>, you want them to generate high-quality leads that result in conversions. Placing the right ad in front of the right person at the right time involves processing a huge amount of data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While paid search advertising still needs a human to make critical decisions, a big chunk of the process is automated. All you need to do is provide information about your target audience, set target keywords, and outline a budget. The rest, from making bids to placing the ad, is done by an algorithm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is taking over tasks such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bidding\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reporting\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competitor analysis in real-time\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trend identification\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Split testing reports\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the complexity of your campaign, you may need to do some of the above tasks manually. However, leaving the majority of them to the AI is likely to generate a higher ROI (return on investment).<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remarketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/how-live-chat-can-maximize-conversions\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2% of visitors convert<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the first interaction with a website. Even if they find the necessary services or products, these potential clients can be distracted or leave to search for other options. Eventually, after gathering all the information, they may buy from your competition simply because their website is the last one they look at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s where remarketing comes in. This fully automated process involves attaching tracking pixels to website visitors and showing your ads to them after they leave the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These people will continue seeing your ads while they browse other websites and <a href=\"http:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media platforms<\/a>. By the time they move down the funnel, your website will be just one click away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can take advantage of remarketing on such platforms as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Ads\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remarketing programs analyze your visitor&#8217;s behavior and use it in tandem with other data to serve up the right ads in the right place and at the right time. All you need to do is to set the audience parameters. AI does the rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does IOS 14 Affect Remarketing?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it stands, IOS 14 users can opt out of tracking while using their iPhones. However, if the user is using a Macbook, Android Phone, or Windows Computer, browsers can still track their page visits and marketers can retarget them if they haven&#8217;t manually opted out through their privacy settings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, in spite of the recent iOS 14 update, remarketing continues to be a valuable tool for advertisers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B Testing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/how-to-do-a-b-testing?_ga=2.151745341.545995759.1582662224-940436819.1565181751\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/b (or split) testing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an integral part of marketing. From testing different types of landing pages to checking various combinations of ad copy, you need to go through numerous options before choosing the best one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/b testing is also highly important for your email and content marketing campaigns. AI collects the data from each test and uses ML to create the right copy for the visitors to click on. Thanks to artificial intelligence, you can test a huge variety of combinations instead of just two or three.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most efficient examples of ML helping with a\/b testing is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7674739?hl=en-GB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google&#8217;s Smart Shopping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&#8217;s an excellent option for e-commerce retailers. All a marketer has to do is provide product details. AI uses this information in different combinations to demonstrate relevant ads across multiple Google Networks. It tests different mixes of text and images to come up with an ad that has the highest conversion potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Optimization<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of <a href=\"http:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">search engine optimization<\/a> (SEO) in growing your business is tough to underestimate. By implementing AI into your SEO strategy, you can improve its performance, accuracy, and efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides helping with keyword search, AI is irreplaceable when it comes to content creation. Long gone are the days when getting to the top of SERPs (Search Engine Page Results) involved stuffing a bunch of keywords into the text. Today, Google uses artificial intelligence to recognize the real value of content on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketers can take advantage of AI to collect information about the target audience and adjust the content to suit its needs perfectly. Additionally, AI helps with the process of content creation by:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing readability\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Catching typos\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggesting headings\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing content ideas\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI offers a high-quality analysis of your SEO efforts. It creates comprehensive reports (e.g. through Google Analytics) to help adjust your marketing strategies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competitive Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A top-notch marketing campaign involves high-quality competitor analysis. While being a copycat is hardly a road to success, peeking at what the competition is doing can help streamline your main tactics.\u00a0 <\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence allows you to gather such important information about your competitor&#8217;s website, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target keywords\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backlinks\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content strategy\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product pricing\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And much more\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-powered tools can collect data from thousands of websites and provide valuable business insights. They are designed to track the entire available digital footprint left by the company on and off the website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This information can help you find loopholes in the competition&#8217;s strategy and capitalize on it immediately. Meanwhile, you can check out what works for your competitors and implement similar tactics into your strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Service<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High-quality customer service is the key to business growth. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/service\/customer-service-stats\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 75% of consumers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommend a brand to a friend after having a positive customer service experience. Many companies are spending millions of dollars on supporting round-the-clock customer service teams. Others rely on chatbots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots are an excellent example of how AI and ML can work for your company. They can provide support to customers during off-hours. While these programs can&#8217;t handle complex issues yet, they can improve customer experience tremendously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots are constantly evolving. Today, they play a secondary support role, but in the future, this software could replace the majority of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/entrepreneur.com\/article\/325830\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer service teams<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Takeaway<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using ML and AI, you can increase your marketing efficiency and improve your company&#8217;s bottom line. Even though artificial intelligence has a high potential, some businesses still avoid it. Implementing these technologies into your business practice can put you ahead of the competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While AI provides high-quality assistance for many aspects of marketing, it doesn&#8217;t replace a human team. AI tools require human supervision to produce top-notch results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re struggling with how to implement ML and AI into your business, schedule a complimentary consultation with our expert marketing staff at Building Brands Marketing, one of the leading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designrush.com\/agency\/digital-marketing\/texas\">Texas digital marketing agencies<\/a>.
