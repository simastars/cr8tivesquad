Even so, there is a line that separates good content from <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content. With the introduction of new AI such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/chatgpt\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat GPT<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, content is easier and faster than ever to create. However, quantity does not always translate to quality, and I believe quality content is pivotal to a successful marketing campaign. Regardless of the industry you&#8217;re in, there\u2019s always a way to take your content to the next level. After all, you put your heart and soul into your craft so your content should reflect that too, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 500;\"><strong>Planning is Key<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it\u2019s not clear by now, allow me to reiterate: quality content is the backbone of any successful website, social media platform, press release or advertisement &#8211; digital and print. Nevertheless, quality content doesn\u2019t just come out of thin air; the best marketing agencies and public relations practitioners know the planning stage is something you should never skip. Implementing a strategy of practices that fully optimize what you\u2019re putting out to your target audience will not only capture their attention but will also garner potential clients and business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although this may seem obvious, brainstorming is crucial. Sit down with your team and create a clear understanding of what your brand is and how you want your message conveyed. Ask yourself the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who is our audience?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What type of content best serves us? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/long-form-short-form-content-best-business\/189453\/#:~:text=Long%2Dform%20content%20is%20typically,examples%20of%20short%2Dform%20content.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-form or short-form?<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are we planning on utilizing social media? If so, what will be the goals between each platform?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What platforms should we be publishing our content on for the best chance of reaching our target audience? <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a solid game plan, you\u2019ll better understand your brand and the message you want your brand to send to the world. Never doubt the effectiveness of a good brainstorming session! Planning and researching is the difference between captivating content and just some words on the internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Switch It Up <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your audience isn\u2019t one-dimensional, so your content shouldn&#8217;t be either. Limiting your brand to one content type will result in you losing out on a whole other audience of potential clientele and customers. For example, if you find yourself only posting on social media, but your website hasn\u2019t been updated in a while, consider writing (or outsourcing, if writing\u2019s not your thing) blogs. This will help your Google rankings, helping your business become more visible to users on the internet. Or, what about email marketing? Have you considered digital newsletters? Studies are showing that email marketing campaigns are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40% more effective<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than social media, making email a vital tool that needs to be in your arsenal of content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8857\" src=\"https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Content_2-300x172.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"172\" srcset=\"https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Content_2-300x172.jpg 300w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Content_2-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Content_2-768x440.jpg 768w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Content_2.jpg 1505w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third party distributed content such as press releases are another great way to spread information about your business\u2019s current happenings. Consider drafting a local press release for events and customer engagement; local releases also will help build a professional relationship between you (your brand) and area media contacts. Using a national press release distribution site like NewsWire can take your brand to new heights if you\u2019re looking to reach clients on a grander scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these components make for a well-rounded marketing strategy for your business. Although you\u2019ll use different mediums, your content should always feel connected. For example. if the tone of your branding is personable, make sure to use that throughout your content.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Stay Consistent<\/strong> <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As creators, we often need help to come up with new and engaging content. It\u2019s totally normal to feel like you\u2019re hitting a roadblock every now and then, but what\u2019s important is you continue to push forward. Having consistent, relevant content about your brand and business will help you stay in front of your audience\u2019s faces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, you may have questioned: \u201cDoes it really matter if I update the content on my rack cards, brochures, etc.?\u201d The answer, of course, is always yes! On top of updating the information on your content pieces, new and engaging designs will help to catch the attention of new and past clientele alike. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, think about how often your day-to-day life changes; your life could look completely different in six months, so why would your business be any different? Consistent content updates help to build a sense of trust between you and your customers. Customers will be more inclined to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theedigital.com\/blog\/update-your-website-regularly#:~:text=helps%20build%20trust%20between%20you%20and%20your%20customers.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trust<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you if they know they can rely on the information on your social media, website and print medium. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Your Brand + Our Team = Stellar Content <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content creation is no small task to undertake.
