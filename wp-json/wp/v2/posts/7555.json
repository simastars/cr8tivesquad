Creating unique content, such as blogs, social media post calendars, press releases, etc can be challenging. Maybe you are struck by writer\u2019s block or maybe you find it difficult to put into words exactly what you do and the benefits to your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Trying to develop a content strategy (yes, strategy) and not a one-off approach can be a daunting task. But, if you think of content development and utilization as a strategy, it can take some of the stress off and help you visualize how to repurpose the content that you are investing time and thought into to meet your needs across multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rework your content to reach a wider audience.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This strategy of content repurposing is basically taking content you\u2019ve created, put a new spin on it, and give it new life to reach new audiences and reinforce your message across your messaging channels. Did you know that your customers typically need to hear your message at least seven times before they decide to do business with you? Hence, sharing your content across multiple messaging platforms is a key component in that strategy. Plus, in terms of search optimization, this approach helps your organic search if you are posting it to your website, across social media, as well as exploring if your content has weight to post to other sites (say to share as a press release with area media that they in turn post on their site, hopefully with a backlink to your website!)<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Struggling on what content to repurpose?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Start with your website!

It was originally a video by Emma but she was able to repurpose the content into a blog for her visitors to read. And might I say, it is quite fantastic!<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video Content<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that 85% of internet users enjoy video content?
