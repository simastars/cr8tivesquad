Perhaps that\u2019s a controversial statement. But, from my eight years of experience in the advertising industry and decade-plus of experience in digital marketing, digital marketing in and of itself with no other media involved in the mix does not work effectively. There is this necessary component that is much less discussed in this digital age: BRANDING.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is branding?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is branding? The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ama.org\/topics\/branding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Marketing Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> describes branding as \u201cA <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller\u2019s good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2022\/04\/19\/digital-marketing-statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">63% of businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have increased their digital marketing budgets just in the past year. With digital marketing becoming increasingly important for every business in this day and age, this has set the stage for many digital marketing providers to be established. However, what I have witnessed many companies I speak with doing is what we refer to in the industry as \u201cbuying space\u201d.\u00a0 A certain amount of impressions here, a banner ad there, this many views, with no real strategic message behind it.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This my friends is where I draw the line. I\u2019m here today to make the statement <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branding Still Matters<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can deploy all the advertising in the world, but if you don&#8217;t have strategic messaging, branding elements and a goal, you can waste a lot of money fast. I\u2019ve witnessed it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8033\" src=\"https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1189\" srcset=\"https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1-300x139.jpg 300w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1-1024x476.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1-768x357.jpg 768w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1-1536x713.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/CROSSROADS-BANK-STATIC-BILLBOARDS_1-scaled-1-2048x951.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see branding is the starting point of all advertising and marketing execution. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before one can even begin mapping out a marketing strategy, you must define your brand. Your story.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What goes into branding?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I work with some great local businesses that run very aggressive digital campaigns. But most of them understand nothing beats old-fashioned relationships. Particularly in the Crossroads market, rarely does a purely digital strategy put their best foot forward. Many businesses in this region require a blend of digital and traditional tactics, tied together with networking events and local sponsorships. They also have very defined branding components in their digital marketing campaigns. All of their ads have a certain voiceover talent, certain color palettes defined in their branding guidelines, and\/or a key tagline that drives through the value proposition of their business. Without these core elements of a brand driving through the core values, mission and value proposition of the company, one is simply \u201cbuying space\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8008 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-07-at-4.17.09-PM-1016x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-07-at-4.17.09-PM-1016x1024.jpeg 1016w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-07-at-4.17.09-PM-298x300.jpeg 298w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-07-at-4.17.09-PM-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-07-at-4.17.09-PM-768x774.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/buildingbrandsmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-07-at-4.17.09-PM.jpeg 1270w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take one of my favorite clients <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.venturastamales.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura\u2019s Tamales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for example. Whether you see an ad for them on tv, hear it on the radio, scroll across it on social media, or drive by a billboard you will notice they all have the same colors, same voice talent (yours truly), same theme song (a universally licensed song they purchased), and even the same closing tagline.
