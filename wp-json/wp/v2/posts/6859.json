The two tactics work perfectly in tandem and will undoubtedly serve as the top referral sources for any business, along with word-of-mouth and social media. \u00a0If working with another party to implement a search marketing strategy for your organization, keep in mind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/511358\/market-share-mobile-search-usa\/\">in October 2018<\/a>, Google accounted for 88.6 percent of the mobile search market in the United States. \u00a0Therefore, it\u2019s important to work with a Google Certified Expert who can assist you with your strategy.<\/p>\n<p>My name is Robert Royer, President of Building Brands Marketing &amp; Consulting. \u00a0I am Google Ads Certified in Search, Display, and Mobile and I have vast experience in large scale marketing campaigns for businesses. \u00a0Building Brands Marketing &amp; Consulting is a full-service marketing consulting company serving businesses in Victoria, TX and the surrounding Gulf Coast region.<\/p>\n<p>Our process is designed to empower your brand and outfit your business with the marketing tools needed for you to succeed.
